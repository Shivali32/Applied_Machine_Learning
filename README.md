## Applied Machine Learning

This repository contains Projects covering core applied machine learning tasks using real datasets, including **regression, classification, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and neural networks**.

### Projects Overview

**Q1: Regression Prediction**  
Predict socioeconomic indicators (GDP per capita, social support, freedom) using linear and polynomial regression, with regularization (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net) and model evaluation.

**Q2: Rock Classification**  
Classify rock types (Igneous, Metamorphic, Sedimentary) using Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and ensemble methods, comparing model accuracy with human performance.

**Q3: PCA & Clustering on Rock Images**  
Apply PCA, t-SNE, and clustering (K-Means, EM) on rock images for dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis, including comparison with human-labeled features.

**Q4: Large Language Models (LLMs)**  
Evaluate a pre-trained CLIP model for image classification under different conditions and visualize embeddings using t-SNE, with Procrustes analysis to compare with human features.
